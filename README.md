# Take the Words Right Out Of My Mouth

*Take the Words Right out of My Mouth* is a performance that invites the audience to have a dialogue with themselves using an artificial clone of their voice. Using machine learning to replicate the human voice we aim to sonify the internal monologue of the individual and experiment with conversation mediums to amplify internal voices.
The performance was commissioned by Setup and launched as part of Re:connect on 16 November 2019. 

you can view images/videos and listen to audio recordings generated by voice cloning here

This repository is the installation application that uses a local virtual machine to do the machine learning and a node web server to display the generated results. 


## HOW TO RUN THE INSTALLATION


1) activate virtual machine
`cd into ~/Documents/pinter-local/voice-clone-cpu`
`activate voice-clone-cpu virtual machine ~/Documents/pinter-local/voice-clone-cpu source bin/activate`

2) turn on node app 

`cd into voicebox` 
launch node app with `nodemon server.js`
