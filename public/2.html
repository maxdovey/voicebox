<i>"Every person has reminiscences which they would not tell to everyone, but only to their friends. They have other matters in their mind which they would not reveal even to their friends, but only to them self, and that in secret.<br> But there are other things which a person is afraid to tell even to themselves, and every person has a number of such things stored away in their mind." </i>
<br><br>Fjodor Dostojevski
